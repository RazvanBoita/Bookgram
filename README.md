## Things i've learned while doing this

- **Migrations** and how to work with them. Even though in the early stages of the project they were a headache, and it was hard to understand them, towards the end I really started to become used to them and actually understand their purpose and how nice they are.
- **Identity** was also something I worked with, and with a quite easy setup, I was amazed to see how easy it is to get authentication and authorization for an app.
- **EF Core**, just like migrations, was a bit hard to grasp in the beginning, but later I found it extremely useful and intuitive, making my work with the database very quick and efficient. 
- **MVC** structure was new for me, as I built this app a bit different than the traditional way (having an API and some frontend that consumes it). Considering I didn't want to focus on the visual side so much, it was a perfect fit.

- **Other key aspects**, such as Dependency Injection and how it works in ASP.NET, Model Binding, Validators, Many-to-many relationships, etc.
